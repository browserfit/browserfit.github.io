##What it is

Starting a RWD workflow may be confusing and overwhelming, so this whole project targets to provide a first step to whoever is starting in this area.

Althought the project's priority is to give people a safe and direct guide to kickstart a project, there are no constraints to where it can lead.
Therefore, feel free to contribute with any information you'd like, being it for beginners or advanced users.
