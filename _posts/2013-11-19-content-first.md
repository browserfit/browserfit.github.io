Coding with a Content-First approach means asking yourself (and whoever is in charge of the project) what is truly essencial in your project. Is striving to actually **mean** what you need to mean instead of pour some content into an already thought layout.

To accomplish that, there're some methods you can try:

1. Let go of `lorem ipsum` as soon as you can. (After all, it's "content-first", right?!)
2. Don't worry so much about the styles for now, add the mark-up to your content. (make sure your tags are meaningful and that you're not bloating your page with elements just to get some crazy shallow styling on)
3. Get feedback as much as you can. There's no one that knows better what the project should be communicating than the person who hired (or is supervising) you. So, as you set content priorities, double-check with them if you are getting the idea.

Content-first sure needs some adaptation, but it pays off really soon. (Just think about all the do-overs you'll be avoiding).

Remember **Content is king**.
