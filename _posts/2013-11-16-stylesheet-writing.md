Stylesheet writing can become really messy as your project grows and you try to mantain everything current and functioning. If you don't want to get lost around a ton of different styles and confusing selectors it's imperative that you choose a methodology for your style-writing.

It's up to you and your team to decide which approach suits best. You can even decide you're creating one methodology of your own, either way, it's highly adviseble that you take some time and read throught the main ones:
