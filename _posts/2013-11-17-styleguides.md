Full-comp layouts don't work well with RWD, mainly because they are **static**, and real RWD is **fluid**. There's a handfull of approaches to think about and implement to your workflow, the best idea would be to know them all and decide based specificaly on the project.

Here's a brief list to check them out:

- [Style Tiles](http://styletil.es/): see them as an abstraction above the Full Comp and below the MoodBoard. It still is *static* file (PSD, e.g.), but it let's you free to work on the browser.

- [Element Collages](http://danielmall.com/articles/rif-element-collages/): thinking the elements one at a time, and later you go joining the pieces.

- [Style Prototype](http://seesparkbox.com/foundry/our_new_responsive_design_deliverable_the_style_prototype): very similar to the Style Tiles, but in the browser.

- [Pattern Lab](http://pattern-lab.info/): Style your elements one at a time, join them progressively until it's completely ready.

As said before, using one does not exclude the use of others, in fact, some of them go really well together.
