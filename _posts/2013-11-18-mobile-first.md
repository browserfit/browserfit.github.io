Depending on perspective, Mobile-First can pass on as an analog expression for Content-First. That happens because they ought to be used in conjunction.

In a literal way, Mobile-First should be called "Small-First". It means that you start coding for the smallest view possible and expand progressively until you get the styles ready for every viewport sizes. As [Stephen Hay](https://twitter.com/stephenhay) once said:

1. Code for the smallest view;
2. Expand until it looks crappy;
3. Insert breakpoint;
4. Repeat.
